          <h4 class="card-title">Interview</h4>
          <p class="card-text">During the initial interview process, I teamed up with another class mate. We had similar questions we wanted to ask and both wanted to interview as many different ages and groups of people as possible. In total, we were able to get 7 different interviews with ages ranging from early 20's to people well into their 60's.
            <br>
            While I didn't understand exactly what I was doing in this first project, I was able to still get some good information that helped me develop my idea further. I learned about how people travelled to their locations, where they stayed during those travels and why, and then used that information to create an app that suited the needs of the users.</p>

          <h4 class="card-title">Proto Persona</h4>
          <p class="card-text">The first persona that I created was the proto-persona, or who I thought the user was going to be before performing the interviews. Once the interviews were conducted and more data was collected, I was able to make a user persona that embodied the key similarities that I found.</p>

          <h4 class="card-title">User Persona</h4>
          <p class="card-text">The user persona was used through out the process, keeping in mind what would be most helpful for them when traveling. This helped to hone in on the main priority of the app, making it user friendly for the older users, and giving me a more concrete idea when I was feeling stuck later during the process.</p>

  <!--WIREFRAMES-->
  <div class="wireframes">
    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <p>
      My first wireframes were sketches that I then created in Figma using minimalistic shapes and staying working in grays. After learning more about the initial wireframe process, I soon learned that I had put too much effort into the initial sketches. I was already planning out my wording instead of mainly focusing on the design. This was definitely something I knew I would have to work on. Sometimes I find it hard to let something be more abstract once I have a vision for what it could become.
      <br>
      Having the wording down when I started the first round of testing was helpful, I found out that the wording was confusing and didn't give users a true understanding of what the app was meant to be. As far as the design, many users didn't understand the rectangles towards the bottom. While I had thought it obvious it meant there were two onboarding pages, others were looking for arrows and a button saying next and back. This was a great insight in the early stages of this project and really helped moving forward.
      <br>
      Another insight I got about mid way through testing was that the wording didn't give a clear idea of what the app does, and there were too many words. People didn't want to sit there and read a few sentences, they wanted one short sentence that got the point across.
      <br>
      Below you will see the progression of the first on boarding page. I wanted to demonstrate how the feedback I got from user testing was executed on this first page and how it progressed throughout the design process.
